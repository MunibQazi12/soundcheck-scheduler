# Soundcheck Scheduler

A production-style frontend system focused on UI architecture, state management, and real interaction flows.

---

## What this project is

Soundcheck Scheduler is a frontend application built to manage and visualize sound-check workflows.

It focuses on:
- Interactive UI behavior
- Audio-related state handling
- Predictable, scalable frontend architecture

This project is not about visuals alone.  
It is about how the UI behaves, scales, and stays maintainable as complexity grows.

## Demo

A short walkthrough showing the scheduling flow, UI interactions, and state-driven behavior.

## Why this project exists

I built this project to reflect how I design frontend systems for real production use.

It demonstrates how to:
- Structure React and Next.js applications for growth
- Build interactive, state-driven user interfaces
- Keep UI, logic, and configuration clearly separated
- Design frontend architecture suitable for real products and internal tools

This is a production-style system.  
It is not a tutorial or a visual prototype.

## Outcome

This project shows my approach to building production-ready frontend systems with:
- Complex but predictable state
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable UI architecture
- Long-term maintainability in mind

---

## Key design decisions

- Component-driven architecture to isolate UI and behavior
- Centralized state handling for predictable UI updates
- Tailwind CSS for fast iteration with consistent design tokens
- Docker for consistent environments across machines

---

## Key features

- Interactive scheduling interface
- Audio-related UI state handling
- Modular and reusable component structure
- Tailwind-based layout system
- Dockerized setup for local and consistent builds

## Project structure

- `src/` — application logic and UI components  
- `public/` — static assets  
- `Dockerfile` — containerized build  
- Configuration files for TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js  

The structure is designed for clarity and long-term maintenance.
